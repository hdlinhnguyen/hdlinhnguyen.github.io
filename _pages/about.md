Hello, welcome to my profile!
I am Linh, a recent graduate with a background in Computer Science and Economics.

I am an aspiring Data/Optimization Scientist with growing interests in quantitative finance and trading strategies, alongside experience in research, consulting, and teaching. Over the past two years as an R&D Research Analyst and through internships in France, I have worked on data-driven projects that combined technical rigor with business insights. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and more recently Generative AI, which I apply to design and develop production-ready machine learning pipelines across diverse industries.

Beyond the technical side, I bring strong communication, project management, and leadership skills. As a teaching assistant in mathematics, I honed my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and foster collaborative learning. Leading projects and consulting engagements has strengthened my business acumen, storytelling, and stakeholder management—skills that help me bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

I am actively seeking opportunities in data science and quantitative finance, where I can apply AI-driven methods and systematic strategies to solve complex challenges. Always open to interesting conversations and collaboration — feel free to connect!
