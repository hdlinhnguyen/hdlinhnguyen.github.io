I am Linh, a recent graduate with a background in Computer Science and Economics.

I am an aspiring Data/Optimization Scientist with experience in research, consulting, and teaching. Over the past two years as a Research Analyst and through internships in France, I have worked on data-driven projects that combined technical rigour with business insights. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and more recently, Generative AI, which I apply to design and develop production-ready machine learning pipelines across diverse industries.

Beyond the technical side, I bring strong communication, project management, and leadership skills. As a teaching assistant for freshmen in mathematics, I honed my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and foster collaborative learning. Leading field trip projects and consulting engagements has strengthened my business acumen, storytelling, and stakeholder managementâ€”skills that allow me to bridge the gap between data and decision-making effectively.

*Actively seeking data science opportunities to apply AI-driven solutions across industries. Available for contact at hdlinh.nguyen19@gmail.com*

I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration, so feel free to connect ^^
