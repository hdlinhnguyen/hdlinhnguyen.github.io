This project trains a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of status posts. In the area of online shopping, this project could be useful to predict customer's sentiment (ie, whether their clients are happy or not). 
The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of social media status and customer reviews.
