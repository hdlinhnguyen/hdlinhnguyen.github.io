Prediction of earthquake damage plays a more vital role in recent days with the faster speed of climate change, so this project aims to provide another insights for disaster management. Using a classification model, this project predicts severe damage to buildings during the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The extension in future research could help improve the forecast of earthquake damage dynamics by considering the shallow subsurface (such as rock properties) and the unnormal seasonal temperature variations [Illien et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57151-8), this thus could help prepare asset risk management after catastrophic events.
