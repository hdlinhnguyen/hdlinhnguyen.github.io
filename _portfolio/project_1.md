To explore this air pollution problem, this project works with air quality data from [https://open.africa/dataset](openAfrica), and the main objective is twofold. The first one is to prepare time series data for analysis and import into a MongoDB database, because of the extensive dataset. Second, for the purpose of prediction, this project builds an autoregression model and improve that model by tuning its hyperparameters.
