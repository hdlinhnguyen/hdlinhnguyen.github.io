To explore this air pollution problem, this project works with air quality data from [openAfrica](https://open.africa/dataset), and the first objective is to prepare time series data for analysis and import into a MongoDB database, because of the extensive dataset. For the purpose of prediction, this project builds an autoregression model and improve that model by tuning its hyperparameters. <br> ***Tech stack:*** MongoDB database, time series analysis
