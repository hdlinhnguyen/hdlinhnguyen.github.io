This side project goes over multiple application examples in academic articles to see how media drived-data can help in predicting financial market variables (trading volume, risk, future stock returns).

## Objective:
- Reproduce the result of the relevant papers, such as [Predicting Performance Using Consumer Big Data](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kenfroot/files/Predicting_Performance_Using_Consumer_Big_Data-Aug18.2021.pdf), etc; 
- Scrape, clean and explore a new dataset;
- Analyze various types of alternative datasets (such as media news) to predict the stock returns and macroeconomic indicators.
